# BridgeLabz SIPP Training Repository

This repository contains all the training exercises completed as part of the BridgeLabz SIPP program. The code and content are organized into separate branches for clarity.

> **Note:** This repository is for personal training use only. **No external contributions are allowed.**

## Branch Names & Descriptions

- **CoreJava**  
  Covers foundational concepts of Java programming, including arrays, strings, methods, and exception handling.

- **OOPS**  
  Focuses on object-oriented programming in Java — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and UML understanding.

- **DSA**  
  Explores data structures and algorithms along with runtime analysis and Java’s collection framework.
